This project was done as part of the Odin Project's full stack JavaScript curriculum. The goal was to create the game of Battleship with JavaScript using test driven development. The game logic was built in a modular fashion - breaking the game logic into its constituent elements of ships, gameboard and player modules. Each module was tested thoroughly with Jest ensuring that all game logic worked as expected.
