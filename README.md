This project was done as part of the Odin Project's full stack JavaScript curriculum. The goal was to create the game of Battleship with JavaScript using test driven development. The aim of the project was to be able to construct the game logic with as little hand-holding as possible. This project was by far the most challenging yet rewarding project I have worked on thus far.
